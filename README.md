# WebAppSecLab — OWASP Top 10 Exercises (DVWA)

**Objective:** Identify and exploit selected OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in a controlled lab, and demonstrate fixes.

**Deliverables in this repo:**
- `attack-scenarios/` — exploit pages & attack notes (SQLi, XSS, CSRF)
- `mitigations/` — secure code snippets for prevention (prepared statements, CSP, CSRF tokens)
- `report/` — Security Testing Report template + placeholder screenshots
- `demo/` — 8-minute demo script and recording checklist
- `docs/` — setup notes (DVWA) and safe-lab reminders

**Important:** This repository contains *exploit code and proof-of-concept payloads intended for lab use only.* Do NOT run these against public or production systems. Use only in an isolated DVWA installation.
